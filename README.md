# Mitochondrial paralogs project code repository

# H1: There is an optimal RNA seq alignment method for paralogous sequences,
# such as the SLC25 family.
# H2: Differential expression of the SLC25 family is predicated on the 
# energetic demand of healthy tissues.
# H3: The SLC25 family are differentially expressed between ischemic and dilated
# cardiomyopathic heart tissue.
